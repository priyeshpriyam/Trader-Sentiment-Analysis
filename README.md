## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between Bitcoin market sentiment (Fear & Greed Index) and the performance of traders on the Hyperliquid platform. The objective was to uncover patterns in trader behavior and deliver insights that could inform smarter trading strategies.

## Key Findings

A critical finding during data validation was that the two datasets covered **different, non-overlapping time periods**. This prevented a direct causal analysis but led to a comparative study of the two distinct periods, with key insights into both market psychology and high-risk trading behavior.
